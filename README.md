ITP220 Fall 2014 - Team Marlins - VWCC - Dr. Wolff

This is the repository for our code and versioning for the assigned group project in class ITP220 fall 2014 session at Virginia Western Community College, Group - Team Marlins.

This is our entire teams first time working as a team, furthermore all of our first times attemtpting to use any sort of code repoisitory and versioning. I decided to set all this up for us, as i believe it will be good for us to learn how people work as a team out in the real world, and understand how things truly function outside of a classroom.
